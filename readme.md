# GodotVMF
![Hero](assets/hero.jpg)
**THIS PROJECT STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT THERE MIGHT BE BUGS**  
  
An importer of VMF files into Godot.  
Useful instrument for people who used to work with Hammer and finds it most comfortable tool for level geometry creation.  
  
Highly recommend to use [Hammer++](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/) since it support precised vertex data that allows you use concave brushes.

## Why?
We with my friend @Ambiabstract didn't found any comfortable solution of 3D level design for Godot so we decided to create our own :)

## Usage
- [Docs](docs/readme.md)

## Features
- Import geometry (Also with smoothing groups)
- Entities support
- Hammer's I/O  system support
- Model import support
  - Requires 3rd party utility [MDL2OBJ](/mdl2obj) (included in the repository)  
- Material import support
- Instances support
- Displacements with vertex alpha
    - WorldVertexTransition materials (blend textures) will be imported as [`WorldVertexTransitionMaterial`](/addons/godotvmf/shaders/WorldVertexTransitionMaterial.gd)
- Native VTF import
  - Supported VTF formats: DXT1, DXT3, DXT5

## Known issues
- Extraction materials and models from VPKs is not supported
- Entities in instances importing not completely. You'll need to open the instance scene and reimport it.
- Wasn't tested on MacOS
- Some of imported models may have wrong orientation
